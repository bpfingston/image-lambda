# image-lambda

## How does it work
    - The Lambda is triggered automatically whenever a user uploads an image to the s3 bucket selected.

## Issues Encountered
    - access denied was a huge problem along with having problems of not being able to access the right file name. I needed to allow access to both the user and on the file itself, so that all everything was allowed to be read.
